    <p>Sophomore at UC San Diego (3.96 GPA) building AI systems that actually work. Currently leading a 1st place team at DS3, where we created an emotion-aware music recommendation engine with 10x performance gains. Previously built RAG chatbots for financial analysis at GSPANN. I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the math and the human side of problems. When I'm not optimizing models or visualizing data, you'll find me on the soccer field, hitting PRs at the gym, or gaming with friends.
